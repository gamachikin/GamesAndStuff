> [!CAUTION]
> If you do want to have the rating system, you will need to set up a Firebase in which you need to create an app and get your **FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID**, **FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY**, and **FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL**. If you are deploying locally, you will want to make a .env file with these things. For deploying to the cloud, just put these in when you find something that says **Environment Variables**.
